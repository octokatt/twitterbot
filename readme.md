# Another Twitter Bot

Seriously, this is a pretty bog standard Twitter bot.  I wanted to make one to get more used to software engineering, instead of my usual for data science.

Ideally, this will eventually be deployed on Heroku, roughly following the advice [in this very nice blog post](https://dev.to/emcain/how-to-set-up-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-heroku-1n39).
